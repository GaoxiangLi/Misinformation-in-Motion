# Real-Time Misinformation Detection Dataset (EAB Dataset)

This repository hosts the continuously updated benchmark dataset for **real-time misinformation detection**. The dataset is designed to evaluate the robustness of misinformation detection models in a dynamic information environment.

Traditional misinformation detection datasets are static and quickly become outdated, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The dataset addresses this gap by:
- Continuously collecting news and claims from **January 2024** onward.
- Integrating **verified annotations** from authoritative fact-checking websites.
- Incorporating **crowdsourced** and **expert-reviewed** labels for unverified claims.
- Supporting benchmark tasks across **multi-source**, **multi-topic**, and **real-time** domains.

This dataset has been used in our paper:
> **"Misinformation in Motion: A Continuously Updated Dataset and Benchmark for Real-Time Misinformation Detection"**
